  <h2>Who These Kits Are For</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Apartment dwellers:</strong> Balcony/yard charging; emergency backup.</li>
    <li><strong>First-timers:</strong> Learn cabling, shading, yield vs. expectations.</li>
    <li><strong>Mobile workers:</strong> Keep laptops/cameras topped up off-grid.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How We Recommend Picking</h2>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Capacity:</strong> 240–500Wh covers routers/lights/laptop for hours. Higher Wh = longer runtime.</li>
    <li><strong>Inverter:</strong> Pure sine wave preferred for electronics.</li>
    <li><strong>Inputs:</strong> USB-C PD (at least 60–100W) simplifies laptop charging.</li>
    <li><strong>Panel quality:</strong> Foldable 100W panels are practical; check connectors (MC4/XT60).</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Recommended Bundles</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>

  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

  <h3>Can these run a full-size fridge?</h3>
  <p>
    No — under-$500 kits are best for small loads and short runtimes. Consider higher Wh and panel wattage for running full appliances. A typical refrigerator needs 100-400W, and you'd want at least 1000Wh capacity for meaningful runtime.
  </p>

  <h3>Is indoor charging safe?</h3>
  <p>
    Use certified gear, avoid blocking vents, and follow the brand's charging/storage guidelines. LiFePO4 batteries are generally safer for indoor use than older lithium chemistries.
  </p>

  <h3>How long do these systems last?</h3>
  <p>
    Quality portable power stations last 500-3000 charge cycles. At one cycle per day, that's 2-8+ years. Panels typically last 25+ years with gradual efficiency decline.
  </p>

  <h3>What about cloudy days?</h3>
  <p>
    Expect 10-25% of rated output on overcast days. Size your system assuming some cloudy days, and keep a backup charging method (car charger, wall outlet) available.
