          <p class="text-amber-800">
            We earn money when we connect you with solar installers or when you purchase products through our links. This never costs you extra, and it helps us keep providing free tools and information.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h2>How We Make Money</h2>
        <p>SolarSavings earns revenue in the following ways:</p>

        <h3>1. Solar Installer Referrals</h3>
        <p>When you submit your information through our Solar Savings Calculator, we may share your details with verified solar installation companies in your area. If you proceed with a solar installation, we may receive a referral fee from the installer.</p>
        <p><strong>This fee is paid by the installer, not you.</strong> It does not increase the cost of your solar installation.</p>

        <h3>2. Affiliate Product Links</h3>
        <p>Our articles and guides may contain affiliate links to products on Amazon and other retailers. When you click these links and make a purchase, we may earn a small commission.</p>
        <p><strong>You pay the same price</strong> whether you use our links or not. The commission comes from the retailer's marketing budget.</p>

        <h3>3. Advertising</h3>
        <p>We may display advertisements from solar companies and related businesses. We are compensated for displaying these ads or when you click on them.</p>

        <h2>Our Commitment to You</h2>
        <p>Despite our financial relationships, we are committed to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Honest recommendations:</strong> We only recommend products and services we believe provide genuine value</li>
          <li><strong>Unbiased information:</strong> Our educational content is based on research, not advertiser preferences</li>
          <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> We clearly identify affiliate links and sponsored content</li>
          <li><strong>Quality partners:</strong> We vet solar installers for licensing, insurance, and reputation</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How This Benefits You</h2>
        <p>Our affiliate relationships allow us to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Provide free solar savings calculators and tools</li>
          <li>Create free educational content about solar energy</li>
          <li>Maintain and improve our website</li>
          <li>Research and review products without charging you</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Editorial Independence</h2>
        <p>Our editorial team operates independently from our business team. We never let affiliate relationships influence our recommendations. If a product or service doesn't meet our standards, we won't recommend it regardless of potential earnings.</p>

        <h2>FTC Compliance</h2>
        <p>This disclosure is made in accordance with the Federal Trade Commission's guidelines on endorsements and testimonials. We believe in full transparency about our business relationships.</p>
